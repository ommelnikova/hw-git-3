## What is a GitHub Issue? ##
Issues in GitHub are text based descriptions of things that need to be addressed, changed or worked in a project or GitHub repo. GitHub issues can help you manage a collaborative project that you are working on with others. All that you need to create an issue on GitHub is a GitHub login. Issues are written in plain text using Markdown to format the content of the issue.
GitHub issues are an excellent way to keep track of bugs and other items that need to be addressed in a project.
GitHub issues can be used to identify and track:
1.	Bugs or problems with code in your repo. For example this thing doesn’t work as expected.
2.	Things that are missing in your repo. For example perhaps something isn’t documented correctly.
3.	Enhancements or new functionality that is needed in the code.
4.	Documentation updates.
5.	General questions and discussion points that need to be considered by all collaborators
6.	and more…
## Best Practices for GitHub Issues ##
There are many best practices to consider when submitting issues to a repository. A few include:
•	Make The Issue Name Descriptive: It is helpful to have descriptive issue titles that tell the code owners what the issue is about. Descriptive titles become particularly important if there are many issues in a repo.
•	Create an Reproducible Code Example (If it is a code bug): If your issue is about a bug in the code, it’s going to be easiest to understand if the code owners can reproduce the bug. Provide some code that someone can copy and run and see the exact bug that you are seeing.
•	Consider Your Tone as You Write: Working with colleagues in a collaborative environment online can be tricky as you don’t have the direct input of people’s facial expressions and response to your comments that you may have in in-person or online meetings. As such, it’s important to consider the tone of the issue as you write it. Rather than being critical and demanding fixes immediately, it is best to constructively point out what is not working and how it could be fixed or address challenges. If your input is well-received by the repo maintainers, it is more likely to be addressed more quickly.
