# Info about `git log --graph --oneline --decorate`
**git log** - shows logs.  
**graph** - draws an ASCII graph representing the branch structure of the commit history.  
**oneline** - condenses each commit to a single line. By default, it displays only the commit ID and the first line of the commit message.  
**decorate** - makes git log display all of the references (e.g., branches, tags, etc) that point to each commit.
