# This repo will have all info about Git that we learned

## Git add files
Git add command is a straight forward command. It adds files to the staging area. We can add single or multiple files at once in the staging area. It will be run as:

**$ git add  file.txt**

  Git Add All
  
We can add more than one files in Git, but we have to run the add command repeatedly. Git facilitates us with a unique option of the add command by which we can add all the available files at once. To add all the files from the repository, run the add command with -A option. We can use '.' Instead of -A option. This command will stage all the files at a time. It will run as follows:
  
**$ git add -A**

Or

**$ git add .** 


## Git status

check the status whether it is untracked or not by git status command as follows:

**$ git status**
