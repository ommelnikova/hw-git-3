## Git checkout 
The `git checkout` command lets you navigate between the branches created by `git branch`. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
#### `git checkout <branch>` 
selects a local branch
#### `git checkout <remote>/<branch>`  
checks out a remote branch to the local machine
