# What is interesting about GitHub?
GitHub is the ultimate tool for collaborative coding. 
- Firstly, GitHub contains powerful versioning software so that it can handle branching and merging easily. This means multiple people can work on the same piece of code, online or offline, which will be saved in the same Git.
- Secondly, GitHub is great for remote collaboration. For those who are not in the same physical location (e.g. remote workers or people working from home), an online Git is an easy solution requiring no setup for new users. With no need to connect to the companyâ€™s VPN, it may be easier to dump everything on a private repository on GitHub.

# The commands in git
**Git checkout**
To work in a branch, first you need to switch to it. We use git checkout mostly for switching from one branch to another. We can also use it for checking out files and commits.
```sh
git checkout <name-of-your-branch>
```
